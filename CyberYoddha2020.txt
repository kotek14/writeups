Steg 2:
Opened the image in steganabara.
Started looking at the color table and looking at every individual color starting with the most popular.
FFFCFCFC ended up being the correct one.

I'm not lying!:
The hint mentioned that I have to listen carefully. I did and noticed something that sounded like a Morse code.
Opened the file in Audacity and started looking at the spectrogram. Indeed, I found a morse code at 15K frequency.
Wrote it all down and loaded it into the morsedecoder.com.

Stegultimate:
Ran steghide --extract -sf stegultimate.jpg, left the password blank. Extracted a nerd meme called steg3.jpg.
Ran steghide --extract -sf steg3.jpg, left the password blank. It contained a text file called steganopayload473955.txt.
Followed the link in that file and downloaded the raw paste with wget https://pastebin.com/raw/YnKqT9s3
It ended up being the base64 encoded PNG file.
base64 -d ./YnKqT9s3 > flag.png
The PNG contained a flag.
